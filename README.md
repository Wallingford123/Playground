# Playground
My programming playground.

Collection of assorted mechanics and little things that I wanted to make.

Maybe kind of potentially cool things:
- Wall climbing (move towards wall to slide slowly, can be jumped off)
- Key, lever and button doors
- Configurable Inventory (Press Space Bar to open. T to spawn an 'bow' that retains properties and stuff)
- Box breaking via jumping on them (+ coin explosion with pickup)
- Ladder
- Moving platform
